# shadcn/ui

- Use shadcn/ui components under `src/components/ui/`.
- Prefer composition over heavy custom components.
- Keep Tailwind classes readable; avoid duplicated class blobs by extracting utilities when needed.
- If adding components, keep naming and folder structure consistent with shadcn conventions.
